# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server 


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/  

Change default port value in application.properties

## Steps
Steps to migrate data -
- Hit schema/v1/_generate API to generate schema of existing master data locally
- Add x-unique and x-ref-schema fields to the generated schema definitions
- Hit schema/v1/_migrate API to trigger migration by port-forwarding new MDMS service
- Hit data/v1/_migrate API to trigger data migration for the existing data
Please ensure that all the data in all masters conform to the same data type otherwise data creation will fail.
